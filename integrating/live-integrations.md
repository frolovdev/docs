### Solana wallet adapter

A quick way to get started with wallet integrations is the [Solana Wallet Adapter](https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-adapter/) package. It is a set of modular TypeScript wallet adapters and components for easily integrating wallets in Solana applications. The package includes starter files, setup and usage instructions, and a live demo showcasing different ui frameworks.
